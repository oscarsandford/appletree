# Eden

Eden is a REST web server primarily designed as an interface for Apple to fetch resources from locally hosted databases.

Why Rust? Because I wanted to learn how to make a web server in Rust!

See `/db` for instructions on how to set up the SQLite database. See `/scripts` for some sample scripts to help automate various setup and maintenance tasks.
